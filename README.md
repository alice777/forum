# forum
The aim of the forum project is to create an online platform that makes it easy for people to participate in the democratic process and influence decision making through micro-campaign contributions. It is going to be about politicians, citizens, causes, campaigns and legislation.  It is an attempt to answer the question - can we use technology to empower the 99% ?
